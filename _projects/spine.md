### Learning Active Spine Behaviors 
In this work, we provide a simulation framework
to perform systematic studies on the effects of spinal joint
compliance and actuation on bounding performance of a
16-DOF quadruped spined robot Stoch 2. Fast quadrupedal
locomotion with active spine is an extremely hard problem, and
involves a complex coordination between the various degrees of
freedom. Therefore, past attempts at addressing this problem
have not seen much success. Deep-Reinforcement Learning
seems to be a promising approach, after its recent success in a
variety of robot platforms, and the goal of this paper is to use
this approach to realize the aforementioned behaviors. With
this learning framework, the robot reached a bounding speed
of 2.1 m/s with a maximum Froude number of 2. Simulation
results also show that use of active spine, indeed, increased the
stride length, improved the cost of transport, and also reduced
the natural frequency to more realistic values
